This repository contains a collection of projects based on the 8051 microcontroller.

    Around 70% of the projects were built and tested on hardware.

    The remaining projects were simulated using Proteus.

    All projects include code and simulation files.

These projects were made during my college time and cover basics of embedded systems like sensors, LCDs, motors, and communication.
